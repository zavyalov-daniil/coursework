# Coursework

## Goal :dart:

The internal logic of many web applications, such as forums, blogs, note-taking applications, 
boils down to create, read, modify, and delete operations on user posts.
The main difference between these systems is the configuration of user access rights to objects and operations on them.

The main goal of the project is to create 
a backend application that can serve as a basis for 
a wide range of applications such as the ones mentioned above.
